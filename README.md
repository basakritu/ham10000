Multi-View Radiomics for Skin Lesion ClassificationAn End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Diagnostic Support🔬 Project OverviewThis repository contains a comprehensive research pipeline designed to classify skin lesions from the HAM10000 dataset. By combining clinical metadata with high-dimensional Radiomics features (extracted from both the lesion core and the perilesional boundary), the project achieves a nuanced understanding of tumor morphology and its surrounding microenvironment.🚀 Key Analytical InnovationsThis project goes beyond standard "out-of-the-box" modeling by implementing custom quality control and feature engineering steps:Hollow-Core Detection Logic: A custom morphological filter that identifies and excludes "thin" or fragmented masks that fail to provide stable textural signals after a $50 \times 50$ pixel erosion.Perilesional Ring Analysis: Developed a "Ring" mask generation script to capture features at the lesion boundary, where critical biological interactions often occur.Data Integrity Audits: Automated scripts to detect null values, zero-inflation, and near-zero variance features to ensure model robustness.Leakage Prevention: Metadata cleaning that strictly maintains a "one-lesion-per-record" rule, preventing the model from over-fitting on multiple images of the same patient.📂 Repository StructurePlaintext├── notebooks/

🛠️ Installation & SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-lesion-radiomics.git
Install dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Data Note: Due to size constraints, the raw HAM10000 dataset is not included. Please download the images and segmentations from [Kaggle/Harvard Dataverse] and place them in the ../dataset/ directory.📊 Evaluation & ResultsThe model is evaluated using a Stratified K-Fold approach to account for class imbalance. Key metrics focused on include:F1-Score: To balance precision and recall across rare classes (e.g., Melanoma).Feature Importance: Identifying which radiomics textures (e.g., Entropy, Sphericity) are most predictive of malignancy.🛠 Technologies UsedImaging: OpenCV, SimpleITK, PILFeature Extraction: PyRadiomicsData Science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-LearnVisualization: Matplotlib, SeabornImbalance Handling: Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE)
